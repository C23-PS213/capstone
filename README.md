## Introduction
Acne is a common problem for females at the age of 18-20 years old. That leads us to a small conclusion that acne is one of the reasons someone's mental state is not good, since people with acne tend to be embarrassed even with just one small acne on their face. Unfortunately, due to the high cost of treatment in beauty clinics, teenagers do not receive acne treatment on time. According to the problem we met, we decided to create an application that can detect acne and also give a recommendation skincare based on the acne type for free. Some features we provide include skin capture, skincare recommendation, and also map to the nearest beauty clinic.
